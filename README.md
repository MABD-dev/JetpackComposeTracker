# Recomposition Tracker for Jetpack Compose

A simple tool to track UI recompositions in real-time for Jetpack Compose. This project allows you to visualize and measure how often your components are recomposed, helping you optimize your UI and understand performance bottlenecks.

Inspired by [React Scanner](https://t.co/jyqyMp9SZ4), this tool shows which composables are being recomposed and how often, with a live count and visual feedback.

## Features

- Real-time recomposition tracking: See when and how your composables are recomposed.
- Live recomposition count: Each component that gets recomposed shows how many times it has been recomposed.
- Visual feedback: Components that are recomposed are outlined with a red border, and their recomposition count is displayed.

## How It Works
This tool uses the ```Modifier.trackRecompositions()``` to track recompositions. When a recomposition occurs, the component will display a red border, and the recomposition count will update.

You can customize the ```trackRecompositions()``` modifier to track different UI components in your app and use this tool to debug and optimize your Jetpack Compose UI.
